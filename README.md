# spend-billionaires-money
A game where you can spend any billionaire's money on any item. Inspired by https://neal.fun/spend, a friend of mine suggested that I make a version where you can buy anything and I decided to extend it by also using Forbes API to fetch a list of all billionaires so the player can select one.

Works by feeding in a prompt to Gemini to ask it to provide an estimation of whatever the user wants.
